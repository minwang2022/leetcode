# 64 Â· Merge Sorted Array
# Description
# Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
# Modify array A in-place to merge array B into the back of array A.

# You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

# Example 1:
# Input:
# A = [1,2,3]
# m = 3
# B = [4,5]
# n = 2
# Output:
# [1,2,3,4,5]
# Explanation:
# After merge, A will be filled as [1,2,3,4,5]

# Example 2:
# Input:
# A = [1,2,5]
# m = 3
# B = [3,4]
# n = 2
# Output:
# [1,2,3,4,5]
