# 433 路 Number of Islands
# Description
# Given a boolean 2D matrix, 0 is represented as the sea, 1 is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, 
# we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.
# Find the number of islands.

# Example 1:
# Input:
# [
#   [1,1,0,0,0],

# 137 路 Clone Graph
# Description
# Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. Nodes are labeled uniquely.
# You need to return a deep copied graph, which has the same structure as the original graph, and any changes to the new graph 
# will not have any effect on the original graph.

# You need return the node with the same label as the input node.
# How we represent an undirected graph: http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph/

# Example1
# Input:
# {1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}
# Output: 
# {1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}

# 611 路 Knight Shortest Path
# Description
# Given a knight in a chessboard (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier) with a source position, find the shortest 
# path to a destination position, return the length of the route.
# Return -1 if destination cannot be reached.
# source and destination must be empty.
# Knight can not enter the barrier.
# Path length refers to the number of steps the knight takes.
# If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

# (x + 1, y + 2)
# (x + 1, y - 2)
# (x - 1, y + 2)
# (x - 1, y - 2)
# (x + 2, y + 1)
# (x + 2, y - 1)
# (x - 2, y + 1)
# (x - 2, y - 1)

# Example 1:
# Input:
# [[0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0]]
# source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] 
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# [2,0]->[0,1]->[2,2]

# Example 2:
# Input:
# [[0,1,0],
#  [0,0,1],
#  [0,0,0]]
# source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2]

# 127 路 Topological Sorting
# Description
# Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

# The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
# Find any topological order for the given graph.
# You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

# Input:
